# Hi, I'm Pantelis

I am a **Cloud Engineering student** based in *Coventry, UK*, originally from *Greece*.  
My main focus is on **Cloud Security** and **DevSecOps**, with an emphasis on building **secure**, **automated**, and **well-documented** cloud infrastructures.

---

## What I Work On

- **Cloud Security Labs** – IAM least privilege, encryption, guardrails  
- **Terraform Projects** – multi-tier architectures, infrastructure as code, automation  
- **Python Tools** – S3 managers, encryption utilities, automation scripts  
- **Experimental Projects** – small builds to practice and grow my skills

## Selected Projects

### [Cloud Threat Detection & Response Lab](https://github.com/pantelovich/cloud-threat-detection-lab)
A Terraform-based lab that simulates and detects cloud security incidents using **AWS GuardDuty**, **CloudWatch**, and **SNS**.  
It demonstrates automated **threat detection**, **alerting**, and **response** workflows in a real-world AWS environment.

---

### [Serverless Secure Web App](https://github.com/pantelovich/serverless-secure-webapp)
A secure, serverless web application built with **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **WAF**, and **RDS**.  
Implements **least-privilege IAM roles**, **encryption at rest**, and **Secrets Manager** integration for secure credential handling.

---

### [IAM Least Privilege Lab](https://github.com/pantelovich/iam-least-privilege-lab)
A hands-on Terraform lab demonstrating **IAM least-privilege principles** and the impact of over-permissive policies.  
Includes **explicit deny guardrails** and reproducible **CLI test cases**.

---

### [Cloud Incident Response Lab](https://github.com/pantelovich/cloud-incident-response-lab)
A Terraform + Lambda lab that **automates response** to AWS GuardDuty findings.  
It detects threats on EC2, **isolates compromised instances**, and **sends alerts via SNS**.

---

## Currently Learning

- **Advanced Terraform** – modular design, pipelines, policy as code  
- **AWS Security Services** – GuardDuty, WAF, Security Hub, Config  
- **DevSecOps Practices** – Checkov, tfsec, Trivy, GitHub Actions

### About This Profile

This profile reflects my journey as a **Cloud Security–focused student** preparing for a professional engineering career.  
I keep every project **open**, **clear**, and **documented**, to show not just what I build — but how I think about building it.
