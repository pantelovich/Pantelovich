# Hi, I'm Pantelis

I am a Cloud Engineering student based in Coventry, UK, originally from Greece.  
My main focus is on **Cloud Security** and **DevSecOps**, with an emphasis on building secure, automated, and well-documented cloud infrastructures.

---

## What I Work On
- Cloud security labs (IAM least privilege, encryption, guardrails)  
- Terraform projects (multi-tier apps, secure architectures, infrastructure as code)  
- Python tools (S3 managers, encryption utilities, automation scripts)  
- Small experimental projects to practice and grow (games, utility apps, coursework)

## Selected Projects

### [**Cloud Threat Detection & Response Lab**](https://github.com/pantelovich/cloud-threat-detection-lab)
A Terraform-based lab that simulates and detects cloud security incidents using **AWS GuardDuty**, **CloudWatch**, and **SNS**.  
It demonstrates automated threat detection, alerting, and response workflows in real-world AWS environments.

### [**Serverless Secure Web App**](https://github.com/pantelovich/serverless-secure-webapp)
A secure, serverless application built with **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **WAF**, and **RDS**.  
Implements least-privilege IAM roles, encrypted storage, and **Secrets Manager** integration for secure credential handling.

### [**IAM Least Privilege Lab**](https://github.com/pantelovich/iam-least-privilege-lab)
A hands-on Terraform lab demonstrating **IAM least-privilege principles** and the impact of over-permissive policies.  
Includes explicit deny guardrails and reproducible CLI test cases.

### [**Cloud Incident Response Lab**](https://github.com/pantelovich/cloud-incident-response-lab)
A Terraform + Lambda lab that automates response to AWS GuardDuty findings. It detects threats on EC2, stops or isolates compromised instances, and sends alerts via SNS.

## Currently Learning
- Advanced Terraform (modular design, pipelines, policy as code)  
- AWS security services (GuardDuty, WAF, Security Hub, Config)  
- DevSecOps practices (Checkov, tfsec, Trivy, GitHub Actions)

This profile is a work in progress as I build more security-focused projects and refine my skills. I like to keep everything I build open, clear, and documented, so that it reflects how I think about cloud engineering as a student preparing for a professional career.
