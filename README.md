# Hi, I'm Pantelis

I am a Cloud Engineering student based in Coventry, UK, originally from Greece.  
My main focus is on **Cloud Security** and **DevSecOps**, with an emphasis on building secure, automated, and well-documented cloud infrastructures.

---

## What I Work On
- Cloud security labs (IAM least privilege, encryption, guardrails)  
- Terraform projects (multi-tier apps, secure architectures, infrastructure as code)  
- Python tools (S3 managers, encryption utilities, automation scripts)  
- Small experimental projects to practice and grow (games, utility apps, coursework)  

---

## Selected Projects
A few repositories I am currently developing and improving:

- [**IAM Least Privilege Lab**](https://github.com/pantelovich/iam-least-privilege-lab)  
  A hands-on IAM lab with Terraform demonstrating the difference between over-permissive policies and well-scoped least-privilege access, including explicit deny guardrails and reproducible CLI test cases.  

- [**Secure 3-Tier Cloud App**](https://github.com/pantelovich/cloud-secure-3tier)  
  A secure three-tier web application deployed on AWS using Terraform. Includes VPC segmentation, security groups, RDS encryption, CloudTrail, and VPC Flow Logs.  

- [**Secure File Encryption Tool**](https://github.com/pantelovich/Secure-File-Encryption-Tool)  
  A Python command-line tool that encrypts and decrypts files with AES, using password-derived keys.  

- [**AWS S3 Bucket Manager**](https://github.com/pantelovich/AWS-S3-Bucket-Manager)  
  A simple Python tool to create, list, and manage S3 buckets securely from the command line.

## Currently Learning
- Advanced Terraform (modular design, pipelines, policy as code)  
- AWS security services (GuardDuty, WAF, Security Hub, Config)  
- DevSecOps practices (Checkov, tfsec, Trivy, GitHub Actions)

This profile is a work in progress as I build more security-focused projects and refine my skills. I like to keep everything I build open, clear, and documented, so that it reflects how I think about cloud engineering as a student preparing for a professional career.
